### Hi there 👋

👩‍💻 I'm a graphic designer who is studying front-end development.

I'm passionate about the web since early 2000s, when all the websites were built using tables or Flash.
At that time I used to create simple websites using HTML and CSS, and then using WordPress.org with themes made from zero by myself.

🖥️ I know well:
 - HTML
 - CSS
 
🌱 What I'm currently learning with The Odin Project: 
 - JavaScript
 - React
